Privacy Policy
Last updated: May 29, 2025

Introduction
This Privacy Policy applies to the game VR Paddle Master. We value your privacy and want to be transparent about how we handle your information.

Data Collection
VR Paddle Master does not collect, store, or share any personal data or usage information with the developer.
The game does not use analytics, advertising, or login systems, and we do not access or transmit any player data to external servers.

However, the game uses some platform features provided by Meta Quest:

In-App Purchases (IAP): The game allows one-time purchases managed entirely by the Meta Quest platform. No payment information is accessed or stored by the developer.

Cloud Storage: Saved game data and player progress may be stored locally on the device and automatically backed up to Metaâ€™s cloud storage. This data is only used by the application to function properly and is not accessed or collected by the developer.

Internet Access and Permissions
The game may require Internet access only to enable in-app purchases and cloud save functionality. No data is shared with the developer or third parties outside the Meta platform.

Childrenâ€™s Privacy
VR Paddle Master does not knowingly collect personal information from children. The game may store local or cloud-based save data, but this information is not accessed or used by the developer in any way.

Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy in the future. Any changes will be posted on this page with a new revision date.
